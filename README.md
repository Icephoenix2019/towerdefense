# Tower Defense 2 (Improvised)
This is one of m old projects that i am bringing back to life! This is all made thanks to rsaihe!
Play the original [here](https://rsaihe.github.io/towerdefense/).

You can also make and edit custom maps using this
[map editor](https://rsaihe.github.io/td-editor/). Instructions are located on
the Github [repo](https://github.com/rsaihe/td-editor/).

### Controls:
* Esc to deselect tower
* Left and right brackets to change map size (will reset game!)
